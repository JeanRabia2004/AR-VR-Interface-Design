#For Task-4 of the internship, I designed a mobile application called StageUp VR, aimed at helping users overcome stage fear and improve their public-speaking confidence. The purpose of this design was to create a modern, motivating, and user-friendly interface where users can practice presentations in virtual reality environments. This app addresses a common pain point—many people struggle with anxiety during public speaking, and they lack safe spaces to practice realistically. StageUp VR solves this by offering immersive VR-based practice rooms and video-based performance analysis.

The design includes key screens such as the Welcome Screen, Signup/Login, Home Page, Practice Mode, and Analyze My Video. Each screen uses a clean layout with rounded cards, soft shadows, and a color theme combining deep blue and bright orange to represent confidence, boldness, and motivation. The Home Screen provides quick actions like “Practice Mode,” “Learn Skills,” and “Analyze My Video,” helping users navigate easily.

The core feature, Practice Mode, allows users to choose their practice environment, such as Classroom Connect, Seminar Sphere, Confidence Stage, Grand Hall, and Pitch Hub.
